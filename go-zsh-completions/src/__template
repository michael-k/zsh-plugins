  # -C: Modify the curcontext parameter for an action of the form `->state`.
  #     The option -C tells _arguments to modify the curcontext parameter for an action of the form `->state`.
  #     This is the standard parameter used to keep track of the current context.
  #     Here it (and not the context array) should be made local to the calling function to avoid
  #     passing back the modified value and should be initialised to the current value at the
  #     start of the function:
  #       local curcontext="$curcontext"
  #     This is useful where it is not possible for multiple states to be valid together.
  # -s: Enable option stacking for single-letter options, whereby multiple single-letter options may be combined into a single word.
  #     For example, the two options `-x` and `-y` may be combined into a single word `-xy`.
  # -S: Do not complete options after a `--` appearing on the line, and ignore the `--`. For example, with -S, in the line
  #       foobar -x -- -y
  #     the `-x` is considered an option, the `-y` is considered an argument, and the `--` is considered to be neither.
